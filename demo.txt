hello people

//git commands
$git version ----gives the current version we are using
$git help config ---gives all the commands of git
$mkdir test--Makes a directory
$cd test--- takes into the directory
 the create a normal text document in test folder

To initialize the text document
$git init

Now to check the status of the created text file use command
$git status--it also says on which branch we have created the file say master

This says nothing is added to commit but something is present.


To add the file to the current directory we use
$git add demo.txt

commit command
$git command -m "Message"
 $clear ---clears the screen

To connect to the github account 
$git global -config user.username SaiPriya00(github account name)


Then go to github account create a repository:test_demo
copy the link of https from repository 
then go back to the bash
Now we need to link the local annd the remote repository
$git remote add origin "link copied_____________________________"
so now we can push a local file to our remote repository
$git push origin master
Now we can see the demo.txt file which we have created in the github account.
