hello people

//git commands
$git version ----gives the current version we are using
$git help config ---gives all the commands of git
$mkdir test--Makes a directory
$cd test--- takes into the directory
 the create a normal text document in test folder

To initialize the text document
$git init

Now to check the status of the created text file use command
$git status--it also says on which brancd tech we have created the file say master

This says nothing is added to commit but something is present.


To add the file to the current directory we use
$git add demo.txt

commit commandg
$git commit -m "Message"
 $clear ---clears the screen

To connect to the github account 
$git config --global user.username SaiPriya00(github account name)


Then go to github account create a repository:test_demo
copy the link of https from repository 
then go back to the bash
Now we need to link the local annd the remote repository
$git remote add origin "link copied_____________________________"
so now we can push a local file to our remote repository
$git push origin master
Now we can see the demo.txt file which we have created in the github account.


To find we have ssh key or not we use

$ls -al ~/.ssh

To generate a ssh key command:folder

$ssh-keygen -t rsa
To get the agent pid command is:
$eval $(ssh-agent -s)
we get agent pid 1696
To find in which place the generated key is present we use the command
$ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Now our ssh will be created in the users admin 
Then open the Microsoft office powerpoint in notepad++
copy the key from that
then open github account under settings fing ssh key
creat new ssh
add the copied ssh key 

Then in the bash to verify everything is going good
use command
$ssh -T git@github.com
